        <h3>Current Project (2019-2020)</h3> 
        <p>
            The project that I am working/worked on is developing a landmine locating
            robot that would be cheap enough to make many of them, as well as being able
            to built with mostly off the shelf parts to facilitate ease of assembly.
            I wanted to do this project because of the large amount of landmines that
            are still in the ground and are still a threat to the local community and/or
            the humanitiaran effort in that area

            A major part of this class is the 21<sup>st</sup> century skills
            that are applied throught the course of the class. These are major
            as they are the main learning method in the class due to the nature of
            project based learning. The 21<sup>st</sup> century skills are
            <ul>
                <li><b>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Find and Use Information/Information Technology</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This was the other big section of the project as most of the work we did was on the computer,
                            especially the design and research proceses. These steps were also some of the most important to
                            the overall success of the project. This helped us to get the majority of the project ready for 
                            the assembly steps. These steps were major in the way of getting the project off of the ground.
                            Our research document is included here under figure 6, and the CAD work is under figures 2 and 4.

                            Under this skill we also worked on getting the Raspberry Pi working and getting the programming to
                            make the robot move in more than just a straight line. This was a lot of work in this skill
                            as the Raspberry Pi falls squarely into this category of 21<sup>st</sup> century skills.
                            Especially as how most of the work with the Raspberry Pi is programming related.

                    <ul>
                        <li>I have used this 21<sup>st</sup> century skill probably the most
                        out of all of the others, as this skill is applied to all of the other skills
                        and is used extensivly in group work to keep the group moving smoothly</li> 
                        <li>
                            A few examples of this skill in use are the creation of our inital group meeting talking about
                            the norms for the group to keep the group civilized and communicating issues and solving
                            problems without heated argument and too keep the project on track. (see fig 1)

                        <li>
                            The other major application of this skill is the CAD process that we went through when
                            designing the robot. This process of turning our ideas from the brainstoming that we had 
                            done to the virtual space so we could 3d print the chassis of the robot. During this phase
                            there was much communication that had to be done to ensure the fit of all of the components
                            on the chassis. (see fig 2)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Figure 2
                            <br>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The next major part of the project that required signifigant communication was 
                            the repair of the metal detector. This part of the project we had some difficulty 
                            with the metal detector that we had as we were slightly overvolting the board and
                            we had to troubleshoot what the problem with the board was. This ended up being
                            a major setback and sticking point for the project. There was much communication
                            that was undertaken to work to decide what to do to fix the metal detector. (see fig 3)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Figure 3
                            <img src="img/board.jpg" alt="Circuit Board with repair" class="figure">
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After working on getting the metal detector fixed, we ran into other problems with
                            getting the Raspberry Pi setup to start work on autonomous movement of the robot.
                            The major problems that we had during this was getting internet to get the proper
                            software and update the os so that it would run more smoothly. This was a major struggle
                            as getting this updated and working more smoothly was holding back us from getting the
                            robot to start with autonomous movement and tracking. We had major communication about how
                            to get the Raspberry Pi up and running so that we could start programming on it, but we ran out
                            of time as this was the last thing that we were working on before COVID-19 caused school to be cancled.

                <li><b>Collaboration</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We had major sections of collaboration that we worked on to get the CAD part of the project done.
                            This goes hand in hand with communication to get the CAD portion of the project done. This was major
                            as getting the CAD done was imperitive to the projects completion. Each team member worked on a different
                            part of the overall cad and wokred to get our portions of CAD done. This collaboration process went well 
                            and helped us to understand and work better with each other. (see fig 4)

                            In addition to collaborating on the cad process and the work involved in getting the CAD done
                            we also collaborated on the acual construction of the robot, working on wireing the the motors and
                            motor controlers to get the robot to move in a mostly straight line. This was an endevor as there
                            were several snags that we ran into as improving the wireing was an endevor as we had already done
                            some of the wireing and improving and fixing it to be more reliable and organized with the space that
                            we had built into the chassis for wireing. (see fig 5)
