        <h3>Current Project (2019-2020)</h3> 
        <p>
            The project that I am working/worked on is developing a landmine locating
            robot that would be cheap enough to make many of them, as well as being able
            to built with mostly off the shelf parts to facilitate ease of assembly.
            I wanted to do this project because of the large amount of landmines that
            are still in the ground and are still a threat to the local community and/or
            the humanitiaran effort in that area
