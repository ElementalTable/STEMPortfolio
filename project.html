        <h3>Current Project (2019-2020)</h3> 
        <p>
            The project that I am working/worked on is developing a landmine locating
            robot that would be cheap enough to make many of them, as well as being able
            to built with mostly off the shelf parts to facilitate ease of assembly.
            I wanted to do this project because of the large amount of landmines that
            are still in the ground and are still a threat to the local community and/or
            the humanitiaran effort in that area

            A major part of this class is the 21<sup>st</sup> century skills
            that are applied throught the course of the class. These are major
            as they are the main learning method in the class due to the nature of
            project based learning. The 21<sup>st</sup> century skills are
            <ul>
                <li><b>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Find and Use Information/Information Technology</b></li>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                <li><b>Creativity and Innovation</b></li>
                <li><b>Global and Cultural Awareness</b></li>
                <li><b>Civic Responsibility</b></li>
                <li><b>Work Ethic</b></li>
                <li><b>Personal Responsibility</b></li>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                <li><b>Communication</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have used this 21<sup>st</sup> century skill probably the most
                        out of all of the others, as this skill is applied to all of the other skills
                        and is used extensivly in group work to keep the group moving smoothly</li> 
                        <li>
                            A few examples of this skill in use are the creation of our inital group meeting talking about
                            the norms for the group to keep the group civilized and communicating issues and solving
                            problems without heated argument and too keep the project on track. (see fig 1)
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            The other major application of this skill is the CAD process that we went through when
                            designing the robot. This process of turning our ideas from the brainstoming that we had 
                            done to the virtual space so we could 3d print the chassis of the robot. During this phase
                            there was much communication that had to be done to ensure the fit of all of the components
                            on the chassis. (see fig 2)
